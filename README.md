## Workshop Overview

This workshop explores how **agent-based modeling (ABM)** and **multi-agent frameworks (MAF)** can be combined with **Generative AI (GenAI)** to build intelligent, collaborative systems.  
Participants will:
- Understand the role of agents and LLMs in AI workflows.  
- Design and simulate agent-based systems using **Mesa**.  
- Build using **Replit**,
- Reflect on explainability (XAI), accessibility, and future extensions.
